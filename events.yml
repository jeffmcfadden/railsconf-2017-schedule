  :description: "Picking an encryption algorithm is like choosing a lock for your
    door. Some are better than others - but there's more to keeping burglars out of
    your house (or web site) than just the door lock. This talk will review what the
    crypto tools are and how they fit together with our frameworks to provide trust
    and privacy for our applications. We'll look under the hood of websites like Facebook,
    at game-changing exploits like Firesheep, and at how tools from our application
    layer (Rails,) our protocol layer (HTTP,) and our transport layer (TLS) combine
    build user-visible features like single sign-on.\n\n            \n                  I

    Common Table Expressions and Window Functions, as well as doing validations in
    the database, and finishing up with executing Ruby code on the database server
    itself, where it runs much faster and can be shared between applications easily.\n\n

    Failing validations, libraries raising exceptions, web services becoming unavailable.
    When this happens, our code ends up becoming defensive against potential failure
    and overall quality deteriorates.\nWhat if we could simplify the process and model
    our code as a succession of commands, with only success and error paths?\n\nWe'll
    work to refactor bloated logic. We'll extract and group code into meaningful objects
    called commands.\nThese commands will then be chained to handle success/failure
    and pass data.\n\n            \n                  Benjamin Roth is a Ruby and
