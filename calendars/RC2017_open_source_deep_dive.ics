DESCRIPTION:At the 2014 RailsConf DHH declared system testing would be adde
 d to Rails. Three years later\, Rails 5.1 makes good on that promise by in
 troducing a new testing framework: ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase. The fea
 ture brings system testing to Rails with zero application configuration by
  adding Capybara integration. After a demonstration of the new framework\,
  we'll walk through what's uniquely involved with building OSS features & 
 how the architecture follows the Rails Doctrine. We'll take a rare look at
  what it takes to build a major feature for Rails\, including goals\, desi
 gn decisions\, & roadblocks.\n\n            \n                  Eileen M.

DESCRIPTION:Open source projects like Rails are intimidating\, especially a
 s a beginner. Itâs hard to look at the code and know what it does. Bu
 t Ruby on Rails is more than just code. Written into it are years of resea
 rch\, discussions\, and motivations. Also written into it are bugs\, typos
 \, and all of the pieces that make the code human. This talk outlines step
 s you can take to explore the inner workings of Rails and gain context on 
 its design. Understanding how Rails works will allow you to write better R
 ails applications and better Ruby code. You will leave with many resources
  and tips on perusing Rails.\n\n            \n                  I am a ful
 l time Rails developer\, part time college student\, and a full time dad w
 ith too much time on my hands. Professionally\, I maintain Rails applicati
 ons used by colleges\, and I bug my coworkers about things I learn in Ruby
 \, Linux\, and Vim. I'm also a big fan of coffee\, and Iâve happily u
 sed it as inspiration for several(most(pretty much all))Â of my personal
  programming projects.\n\nAlex Kitchens\n                \n

DESCRIPTION:RSpec gives you many ways to test your Rails app. Controller\, 
 view\, model\, and so on. Often\, it's not clear which to use. In this tal
 k\, you'll get some practical advice to improve your testing by understand
 ing how RSpec integrates with Rails. To do this we'll look through some re
 al world RSpec bugs\, and with each one\, clarify our understanding of the
  boundaries between RSpec and Rails.\n\nIf you're looking to level up your
  testing\, understand RSpec's internals a little better\, or improve your 
 Rails knowledge\, this talk will have something for you. Some knowledge of
  RSpec's test types will be assumed.\n\n            \n                  Sa
