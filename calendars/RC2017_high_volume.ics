DESCRIPTION:Shopify has taken Rails through some of the world's largest sal
 es: Superbowl\, Celebrity Launches\, and Black Friday. In this talk\, we w
 ill go through the evolution of the Shopify infrastructure: from re-archit
 ecting and caching in 2012\, sharding in 2013\, and reducing the blast rad
 ius of every point of failure in 2014. To 2016\, where we accomplished run
 ning our 325\,000+ stores out of multiple datacenters. It'll be whirlwind 
 tour of the lessons learned scaling one of the world's largest Rails deplo
 yments for half a decade.\n\n            \n                  When Simon's 
 not researching walruses or playing chaos monkey for the company's infrast
 ructure\, he's hard at work taming the wildlife of production\, protecting
  Shopify from flash sales\, scale\, misbehaving resources and itself. Othe
 r than that\, as a new resident of Canada\, fulfilling his obligation to c
 all everyone out when they think they've experienced "cold weather".\n\nSi

DESCRIPTION:Using a standard Rails stack is great\, but when you want to pr
 ocess streams of data at a large scale you'll hit the stack's limitations.
  What if you want to build an analytics system on a global scale and want 
 to stay within the Ruby world you know and love?\n\nIn this talk we'll see
  how we can leverage Kafka to build and painlessly scale an analytics pipe
 line. We'll talk about Kafka's unique properties that make this possible\,
  and we'll go through a full demo application step by step. At the end of 
 the talk you'll have a good idea of when and how to get started with Kafka
  yourself.\n\n            \n                  Co-founder of AppSignal from

DESCRIPTION:Bernie Sanders popularized crowdfunding in politics by raising 
 $220 million in small donations.\n\nAn example of the challenges with hand
 ling a high volume of donations is the 2016 New Hampshire primary night\, 
 when Sanders asked a national TV audience to donate $27. Traffic peaked at
  300K requests/min and 42 credit card transactions/sec.\n\nActBlue is the 
 company behind the service used not only by Sanders\, but also 16\,600 oth
 er political organizations and charities for the past 12 years.\n\nThis pr
 esentation is about the lessons we learned building a high performance fun
 draising platform in Rails.\n\n            \n                  Braulio wor

DESCRIPTION:Is your application running too slow? How can you make it run l

 l\, the panelists will discuss their favorite performance related tools an
 d guidelines. Expect to learn about changes in Ruby 2.4 and beyond that ma
