DESCRIPTION:Ever wonder why applications use sessions and APIs use tokens? 
 Must there really be a difference? JSON Web Tokens are an emerging standar
 d for portable secure messages. We'll talk briefly about how they're built
  and how they earn your trust\, then dig into some practical examples you 
 can take back and apply to your own majestic monolith or serious services.

  experience across the full stack but an emphasis in backend and platform 
 engineering. His idea of a productive week is cleaning out the darkest cor
 ners in a codebase or puzzling out how to make the right solution simple. 
 Currently he's distilling 8 years of Kickstarter experience into Keratin A

DESCRIPTION:"That's not very RESTful." As a Rails developer you've probably
  heard or even\nspoken that proclamation before\, but what does it really 
 mean? What's so great\nabout being RESTful anyway?\n\nRESTful architecture
  can narrow the responsibilities of your Rails controllers\nand make follo
 w-on refactorings more natural. In this talk\, you'll learn to\nrefactor c
 ode to follow RESTful principles and to identify the positive\nimpact thos
 e changes have throughout your application stack.\n\n            \n

DESCRIPTION:For some\, making web applications accessible is a must\; Gover

 l risk.\n\nBut for others it seems like a luxury\; Consultants are expensi
 ve\, and so are the developer hours spent trying to parse the notoriously 
 hard-to-read WCAG 2.0 docs.\n\nThere is an easier way to start!\n\nIn this
  session\, we will demystify the WCAG 2.0 basics. Weâll use Chrome Ac
 cessibility Dev Tools to discover and fix common issues. You will leave wi
 th a set of free and easy-to-use resources to start improving the accessib

DESCRIPTION:Tests try to observe change. But are some systems too big to ob
 serve them all? What if we need to test a function with a very complex out
 put?\n\nIn this talk\, we'll explore a Gold Master testâ a special te
 st for evaluating complicated legacy systems. We'll look at how this test 
 takes an input\, such as a production database\, runs it through a transfo
 rmative function\, and then compares the output to an approved version of 
 the output.\n\nTesters of every experience level will leave this talk with
  a new technique for evaluating complex environments\, and a broader conce
 ption of what a test can be.\n\n            \n                  Jake is a

DESCRIPTION:What if your Rails app couldnât tell who was visiting it? 
 If you had no idea that the same person requested two different pages? If 
 all the data you stored vanished as soon as you returned a response? The s
 ession is the perfect place to put this kind of data.\n\nBut sessions can 
 be a little magical. What is a session? How does Rails know to show the ri
 ght data to the right person? And how do you decide where you keep your se
 ssion data?\n\n            \n                  Justin Weiss leads the deve

 \, or nest your models\, or do some other calisthenic to get everything wo
 rking. Thankfully there's a better way! This talk takes a complicated wiza

DESCRIPTION:Steve Jobs. Linus Torvalds. Alan Turing.\n\nBeen there\, done t
 hat.\n\nThe interesting stories often arenât the ones we grew up with
 \; theyâre the ones weâve left behind. When it comes to tech\, t
 hat means its women\, and especially its women of color. And while thereâ
 s been a greater emphasis lately on rediscovering womenâs contrib
 utions to technology\, we need to expand our focus beyond just Grace Hoppe
 r and Ada Lovelace.\n\nFrom Radia Perlman to Sophie Wilson to Erica Baker\
 , let's explore both techâs forgotten heroes and its modern-day pione
 ers\, and help end the silent erasure of women in technology.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:People give ruby a bad reputation for speed\, efficiency\, weak
  typing\, etc. But one of the biggest benefits of an interpreted language 
 is the ability to debug and introspect quickly without compilation. Oftent
 imes developers reach for heavy-handed libraries to debug their applicatio
 n when they could just as easily get the information they need by using to
 ols they already have.\n\nIn this talk you will learn practical techniques
  to make debugging easier. You will see how simple techniques from the rub
 y standard library can greatly increase your ability to keep your codebase
  clean and bug-free.\n\n            \n                  I'm a software dev
 eloper at Localytics in Boston. I'm passionate about object-oriented progr
 amming\, working well with ruby\, and craft beer. I've been working with r

DESCRIPTION:Ruby and Rails famously prioritised developer happiness\, and t
 ook the world by storm. Elm\, a new language that compiles to JavaScript\,
  proves that putting developer happiness first can produce very different 
 results on the front end! Born out of Haskell\, Elm is as unlike Ruby as p
 rogramming languages get\, but in this session weâll see how its part
 icular blend of design decisions tackles everything thatâs painful ab
 out front-end development\, making it an excellent choice for the curious 
 Rubyistâs next favorite language.\n\n            \n

DESCRIPTION:Elixir has rapidly developed into a mature language with an eve
 r-growing library of packages that excels at running web apps. And because
  both Elixir and Phoenix were developed by Ruby / Rails programmers\, the 
 ease with which you can learn Elixir as a Ruby developer\, is much greater
  than many other  languages. With numerous code examples\, this talk will 
 discuss how learning a functional approach to handling web requests can im
 prove what we do every day with Rails. This talk is aimed at people who ha
 ve some familiarity with Rails but no experience with Elixir is necessary.

DESCRIPTION:You've added background jobs. You have calls to external servic
 es that perform actions asynchronously. Your data is no longer always in o
 ne perfect state-- it's in one of tens or hundreds of acceptable states.\n
 \nHow can you confidently ensure that your data is valid without validatio
 ns?\n\nIn this talk\, Iâll introduce some data consistency issues you
  may see in your app when you begin introducing background jobs and extern
 al services. Youâll learn some patterns for handling failure so your 
 data never gets out of sync and weâll talk about strategies to detect
  when something is wrong.\n\n            \n                  The granddaug

DESCRIPTION:There are a lot of database index and query best practices that
  sometimes aren't best practices at all. Need all users created this year?
  No problem! Slap an index over created_at! What about this year's active 
 OR pending users\, sorted by username? Are we still covered index-wise? Is
  the query as fast with 20 million users? Common rules of thumb for indexi
 ng and query crafting arenât black and white. We'll discuss how to tr
 ack down these exceptional cases and walk through some real examples. You'
 ll leave so well equipped to improve performance\, you won't be able to op

DESCRIPTION:It'll happen eventually. Someone will come down with a feature 
 request for your app to "create dashboards and reporting on our data". So 
 how do you go about doing it? What parts of your database should you start
  thinking about differently? What is "reporting" anyway? Is ActiveRecord e
 nough to pull this off?\n\nLet's go on a journey through the world of Rela
 tional Online Analytical Processing (ROLAP) and see how this can apply to 
 Rails. We'll also look at database considerations and finish with looking 
 at a light DSL that works with ActiveRecord to help make your data dance.\

  can you understand the health of the system as a whole? Distributed traci
 ng can help! Youâll learn the theory behind how distributed tracing w

DESCRIPTION:As systems get more complex they inevitably fail. Many of those
  failures are preventable.\n\nWeâre not lazy\, stupid\, or careless. 
 The complexity of our systems simply exceeds our cognitive abilities. Than
 kfully\, weâre not alone. People have successfully managed complex sy
 stems long before software came along. \n\nIn this session\, weâll se
 e how surgeons\, pilots\, and builders have developed techniques to safely
  manage increasingly complex systems in life and death situations. We will
  learn how simple checklists improve communication\, reduce preventable er
 rors\, and drive faster recovery time.\n\n            \n
