DESCRIPTION:The history of programming is filled with examples of bugs that
  actually turned out to be features and limitations that pushed developers
  to make an even more interesting product. Weâll journey through code
  that was so âbadâ it was actually good. Then weâll learn t
 o tame our inner perfectionists so our code will be even better than it is
  today.\n\n            \n                  Jessica Rudder is a recovering 
 perfectionist that learns to code through a combination of reading\, askin
 g colleagues and banging her head against a wall. When she's not helping t
 o build Flatiron School's Learn platform\, she can be found training for u
 ltra marathons on the streets of NYC or creating code-related videos on Yo
 uTube for CompChomp. She is an avid squirrel photographer and loves the co
 lor green.\n\nJess Rudder\n                \n                \n

DESCRIPTION:We have amazing skills and abilities\, but for a lot of us the 
 missing piece is finding a way to give back. We have an amazing panel of p

 d current to make the world a better place. Learn how they got involved\, 
 and in turn what you can do to get involved in areas youâre passionat
 e about to fill this missing piece that will keep you happy throughout you
 r career.\n\n            \n                  In her previous life\, Polly

DESCRIPTION:Programming is a deeply mental art. As programmers\, we invest 
 large amounts of time in mastering new languages\, new techniques\, and ne
 w tools. But all too often\, we neglect our understanding of the most impo
 rtant tool in the developer's toolbox: the programmer's brain itself.\n\nI
 n this talk\, we will combine the art of programming with the science of c
 ognitive psychology\, and emerge with a deeper understanding of how to lev
 erage the limits of the human mind to sustainably craft software that is l
 ess buggy\, easier to understand\, and more adaptive in the face of change
