DESCRIPTION:Woodworking has experienced quite a renaissance as of late\, an
 d a very popular style involves using power tools for rough work and hand 
 tools for detail and precision work. Using both defines each woodworker's 
 speed and ability to produce beautiful/functional pieces. The same can be 
 true of developers. What can we as developers learn from this mix of moder
 n and ancient craft? Come find out.\n\n            \n                  Bas
 ed in Austin\, TX\, Mark has 15 years of full time development experience\
 , 9 of which have been in Ruby and Rails.   He's been at Upworthy and Stit

DESCRIPTION:Over the past year\, Iâve spoken at several conferences\, 
 lost 30 pounds\, and worked up to running my first 5K\, all while leading 
 an engineering team and spending significant time with my family. I also h
 ave less willpower than just about everyone I know. So howâd I accomp
 lish those things?\n\nLetâs talk about how to build goals the right w
 ay so that youâll be all but guaranteed to hit them. Weâll work 
 through the process of creating systems and nurturing habits to turn your 
 brain into your biggest ally\, no matter what you want to accomplish!\n\n

  sometimes brings out the absolute best in the people it happens to. When
