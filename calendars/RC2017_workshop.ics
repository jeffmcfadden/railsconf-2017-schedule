DESCRIPTION:The effectiveness of your team is limited by your communication
 . To be a great developer we need to be able to express ideas into code. T
 o be a great developer on a team we need to be able to transfer those idea
 s and that code between other humans.\n\nIn this workshop we will be focus
 ed on improving our own teams by improving our own communication. We will 
 learn how to give more effective and meaningful code feedback\, how to bre
 ak complex ideas down into simple jargon free components\, and we will dis
 cuss how we can build better teams and streamline our development processe
 s.\n\n            \n                  Justin is a developer\, educator\, s

DESCRIPTION:In a world we teach ourselves a lot of things\, why not do it R
 uby-on-Rails-on-Pi way? Letâs get our hands on a piece of hardware\, 
 understand what it takes to setup one up\, install a couple of libraries\,
  Ruby\, RVM\, RBENV\, a GUI. Letâs get a couple of sensors: motion\, 
 temperature\, humidity\, tsunami\, ectoplasm and see if we detect a cool t
 hing or two.\nLet's discuss how we can use what we know about Rails to exp
 lore things on a RaspberryPi. From a practical point of view\, we will go 
 through installation\, setup\, and build a monitoring Motion Sensor applic

DESCRIPTION:You have likely heard of test-driven development. In many circl
 es it's touted as the only way to write software. Indeed\, TDD is a powerf
 ul tool in writing software that not only works\, but continues to work as
  time and features pass. However\, when learning to test-drive software\, 
 you're often left confused about where to start and which direction to go.
 \n\nThis talk will provide some some gentle advice about TDD as we interac
 tively iterate on an app starting with a proposed feature\, adding tests\,
  building the implementation\, and refactoring to the final solution.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:We have all experienced moments when our app does not work as e

 we could simplify the process and model our code as a succession of comman
 ds\, with only success and error paths?\n\nWe'll work to refactor bloated 
 logic. We'll extract and group code into meaningful objects called command
 s.\nThese commands will then be chained to handle success/failure and pass
