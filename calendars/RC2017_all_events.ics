DESCRIPTION:Picking an encryption algorithm is like choosing a lock for you
 r door. Some are better than others - but there's more to keeping burglars
  out of your house (or web site) than just the door lock. This talk will r
 eview what the crypto tools are and how they fit together with our framewo
 rks to provide trust and privacy for our applications. We'll look under th
 e hood of websites like Facebook\, at game-changing exploits like Fireshee
 p\, and at how tools from our application layer (Rails\,) our protocol lay
 er (HTTP\,) and our transport layer (TLS) combine build user-visible featu
 res like single sign-on.\n\n            \n                  I am a softwar

 Must there really be a difference? JSON Web Tokens are an emerging standar

  and how they earn your trust\, then dig into some practical examples you 
 can take back and apply to your own majestic monolith or serious services.

DESCRIPTION:Tests try to observe change. But are some systems too big to ob

 put?\n\nIn this talk\, we'll explore a Gold Master testâ a special te
 st for evaluating complicated legacy systems. We'll look at how this test 
 takes an input\, such as a production database\, runs it through a transfo

 the output.\n\nTesters of every experience level will leave this talk with
  a new technique for evaluating complex environments\, and a broader conce

DESCRIPTION:At the 2014 RailsConf DHH declared system testing would be adde
 d to Rails. Three years later\, Rails 5.1 makes good on that promise by in
 troducing a new testing framework: ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase. The fea
 ture brings system testing to Rails with zero application configuration by
  adding Capybara integration. After a demonstration of the new framework\,
  we'll walk through what's uniquely involved with building OSS features & 
 how the architecture follows the Rails Doctrine. We'll take a rare look at
  what it takes to build a major feature for Rails\, including goals\, desi

DESCRIPTION:RSpec gives you many ways to test your Rails app. Controller\, 
 view\, model\, and so on. Often\, it's not clear which to use. In this tal
 k\, you'll get some practical advice to improve your testing by understand
 ing how RSpec integrates with Rails. To do this we'll look through some re
 al world RSpec bugs\, and with each one\, clarify our understanding of the
  boundaries between RSpec and Rails.\n\nIf you're looking to level up your
  testing\, understand RSpec's internals a little better\, or improve your 
 Rails knowledge\, this talk will have something for you. Some knowledge of
  RSpec's test types will be assumed.\n\n            \n                  Sa
 m Phippen is an Engineer at DigitalOcean. He comes to the table with enthu
 siasm\, and a great deal of love for the Ruby community. He fights for the

DESCRIPTION:People give ruby a bad reputation for speed\, efficiency\, weak
  typing\, etc. But one of the biggest benefits of an interpreted language 
 is the ability to debug and introspect quickly without compilation. Oftent
 imes developers reach for heavy-handed libraries to debug their applicatio
 n when they could just as easily get the information they need by using to
 ols they already have.\n\nIn this talk you will learn practical techniques
  to make debugging easier. You will see how simple techniques from the rub
 y standard library can greatly increase your ability to keep your codebase
  clean and bug-free.\n\n            \n                  I'm a software dev

DESCRIPTION:Ruby and Rails famously prioritised developer happiness\, and t

 results on the front end! Born out of Haskell\, Elm is as unlike Ruby as p
 rogramming languages get\, but in this session weâll see how its part
 icular blend of design decisions tackles everything thatâs painful ab
 out front-end development\, making it an excellent choice for the curious 
 Rubyistâs next favorite language.\n\n            \n

DESCRIPTION:Elixir has rapidly developed into a mature language with an eve
 r-growing library of packages that excels at running web apps. And because
  both Elixir and Phoenix were developed by Ruby / Rails programmers\, the 
 ease with which you can learn Elixir as a Ruby developer\, is much greater
  than many other  languages. With numerous code examples\, this talk will 
 discuss how learning a functional approach to handling web requests can im
 prove what we do every day with Rails. This talk is aimed at people who ha
 ve some familiarity with Rails but no experience with Elixir is necessary.

 arily Rails shop in Chicago\, IL\, Christian works on both new and legacy 
 Rails apps\, and has brought a smattering of Elixir/Phoenix into the shop.
  Professionally his interests include operational security including imple
 mentation of cryptographic libraries\, Ruby\, Rails\, Elixir\, Phoenix\, D
 ocker\, and Elastic Search. Christian tries to gain experience in every fr
 ame of the dev stack\, from servers and dev-ops all the way through to the
  javascript in the browser.\n\nChristian Koch\n                \n

 ical example? And who hasn't watched the 1997 classic with Jack and Rose? 
 In this talk we will first take a look at some real historical data of the
  event. Then we will use amazing Python libraries to live code several of 
 the most well known algorithms. This will help us understand some fundamen
 tal concepts of how machine learning works. When we're done\, you should h
 ave a good mental framework to make sense of it in the modern world.\n\n

 ted could be combined to form a more certain estimate. It turns out that t
 his extremely simple idea has a profound impact on how we write programs a
 nd how we can think about life. The applications range from machine learni

DESCRIPTION:Mutation testing is a silver bullet for assessing test quality.
  Mutation testing will help you: \n\n\nWrite better tests\nProduce more ro
 bust code that better handles edge cases\nReveal what parts of your legacy
  application are most likely to break before you dive in to make new chang
 es\nLearn about features in Ruby and your dependencies that you didnâ
 t previously know about\n\n\nThis talk assumes a basic knowledge of Ruby a
 nd testing. The examples in this talk will almost certainly teach you some
 thing new about Ruby!\n\n            \n                  John Backus is th

DESCRIPTION:The attempted rewrite is over\, the dust has settled\, and the 
 monolith isnât going away. After all\, itâs still the app that m
 akes all the money. On the other hand\, nobody wants to work on it\, every
  new feature takes forever\, and your entire team is afraid of making any 
 change for fear of the whole thing collapsing in on itself.\n\nIn this ses
 sion\, weâll walk through some of the technical and social problems t
 hat arise from difficult codebases. Weâll learn to stop making things
  worse\, to measure what we need to change\, and start making progress.\n\

DESCRIPTION:You've added background jobs. You have calls to external servic
 es that perform actions asynchronously. Your data is no longer always in o
 ne perfect state-- it's in one of tens or hundreds of acceptable states.\n
 \nHow can you confidently ensure that your data is valid without validatio
 ns?\n\nIn this talk\, Iâll introduce some data consistency issues you
  may see in your app when you begin introducing background jobs and extern
 al services. Youâll learn some patterns for handling failure so your 
 data never gets out of sync and weâll talk about strategies to detect
  when something is wrong.\n\n            \n                  The granddaug

 ucks that trend\, spreading across 6 states and 4 countries. Dev teams con
 sider themselves "Remote First"\, while DevOps and Application Support are
  "Local First." Each has adopted tools\, habits\, and practices to maximiz

DESCRIPTION:As our applications grow\, we start thinking of better ways to 
 organize and scale our growing codebases. We've recently seen Microservice
 s start to emerge as a prominent response to Monoliths\, but is it all rea
 lly worth it? What about our other options? We often romanticize leaving o
 ur current architecture situation because we believe it will cure what ail

DESCRIPTION:Using a standard Rails stack is great\, but when you want to pr
 ocess streams of data at a large scale you'll hit the stack's limitations.
  What if you want to build an analytics system on a global scale and want 
 to stay within the Ruby world you know and love?\n\nIn this talk we'll see
  how we can leverage Kafka to build and painlessly scale an analytics pipe
 line. We'll talk about Kafka's unique properties that make this possible\,
  and we'll go through a full demo application step by step. At the end of 
 the talk you'll have a good idea of when and how to get started with Kafka
  yourself.\n\n            \n                  Co-founder of AppSignal from

  No problem! Slap an index over created_at! What about this year's active 
 OR pending users\, sorted by username? Are we still covered index-wise? Is
  the query as fast with 20 million users? Common rules of thumb for indexi

DESCRIPTION:It'll happen eventually. Someone will come down with a feature 
 request for your app to "create dashboards and reporting on our data". So 
 how do you go about doing it? What parts of your database should you start
  thinking about differently? What is "reporting" anyway? Is ActiveRecord e
 nough to pull this off?\n\nLet's go on a journey through the world of Rela
 tional Online Analytical Processing (ROLAP) and see how this can apply to 
 Rails. We'll also look at database considerations and finish with looking 
 at a light DSL that works with ActiveRecord to help make your data dance.\

 iew\, right? "A little logic here... a little logic there..." but all of a
  sudden we hardly recognize our views. A quick glance through our code and

 pportunity for some refactoring! Come see several approaches you can start
  using today to clean up your views.\n\n            \n                  Ja
