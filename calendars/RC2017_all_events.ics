DESCRIPTION:Picking an encryption algorithm is like choosing a lock for you
 r door. Some are better than others - but there's more to keeping burglars
  out of your house (or web site) than just the door lock. This talk will r
 eview what the crypto tools are and how they fit together with our framewo
 rks to provide trust and privacy for our applications. We'll look under th
 e hood of websites like Facebook\, at game-changing exploits like Fireshee
 p\, and at how tools from our application layer (Rails\,) our protocol lay
 er (HTTP\,) and our transport layer (TLS) combine build user-visible featu
 res like single sign-on.\n\n            \n                  I am a softwar

  to make an even more interesting product. Weâll journey through code

DESCRIPTION:Ever wonder why applications use sessions and APIs use tokens? 
 Must there really be a difference? JSON Web Tokens are an emerging standar
 d for portable secure messages. We'll talk briefly about how they're built
  and how they earn your trust\, then dig into some practical examples you 
 can take back and apply to your own majestic monolith or serious services.

 takes an input\, such as a production database\, runs it through a transfo

 the output.\n\nTesters of every experience level will leave this talk with

 d to Rails. Three years later\, Rails 5.1 makes good on that promise by in
 troducing a new testing framework: ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase. The fea
 ture brings system testing to Rails with zero application configuration by
  adding Capybara integration. After a demonstration of the new framework\,
  we'll walk through what's uniquely involved with building OSS features & 
 how the architecture follows the Rails Doctrine. We'll take a rare look at

DESCRIPTION:Forms are a crucial part of every app and Rails has good defaul
 ts for building themâunless you need something complicated. Maybe you
  want a multi-step wizard? Or maybe you'd like to pluck attributes from an
 y model? Validation becomes a pain point. So you introduce a state machine
 \, or nest your models\, or do some other calisthenic to get everything wo
 rking. Thankfully there's a better way! This talk takes a complicated wiza
 rd and converts it into a few simple form objectsâit's a deep dive on
  decoupling models and how you can leverage Trailblazer's Reform gem to ma
 ke it even easier.\n\n            \n                  Andrew Markle was a

DESCRIPTION:People give ruby a bad reputation for speed\, efficiency\, weak
  typing\, etc. But one of the biggest benefits of an interpreted language 
 is the ability to debug and introspect quickly without compilation. Oftent
 imes developers reach for heavy-handed libraries to debug their applicatio
 n when they could just as easily get the information they need by using to
 ols they already have.\n\nIn this talk you will learn practical techniques
  to make debugging easier. You will see how simple techniques from the rub
 y standard library can greatly increase your ability to keep your codebase
  clean and bug-free.\n\n            \n                  I'm a software dev

DESCRIPTION:Ruby and Rails famously prioritised developer happiness\, and t
 ook the world by storm. Elm\, a new language that compiles to JavaScript\,
  proves that putting developer happiness first can produce very different 
 results on the front end! Born out of Haskell\, Elm is as unlike Ruby as p
 rogramming languages get\, but in this session weâll see how its part
 icular blend of design decisions tackles everything thatâs painful ab
 out front-end development\, making it an excellent choice for the curious 
 Rubyistâs next favorite language.\n\n            \n

DESCRIPTION:You have likely heard of test-driven development. In many circl
 es it's touted as the only way to write software. Indeed\, TDD is a powerf
 ul tool in writing software that not only works\, but continues to work as
  time and features pass. However\, when learning to test-drive software\, 
 you're often left confused about where to start and which direction to go.
 \n\nThis talk will provide some some gentle advice about TDD as we interac
 tively iterate on an app starting with a proposed feature\, adding tests\,
  building the implementation\, and refactoring to the final solution.\n\n

  and instructor at Big Nerd Ranch. He works fully remote from (sweet) home

DESCRIPTION:Ever had a production bug that you fixed by changing production
  data? Ever felt like a bad developer for it? Don't. Bad data has countles
 s causes: Weird user input. Race conditions under load. Heck\, even changi
 ng business needs. We can't fully prevent data corruption\, so what matter
 s is how we recover. In this talk\, you'll learn how to prevent and fix ba
 d data at every level of your system. You'll learn UX techniques for incre
 mental\, mistake-reducing input. You'll learn how to future-proof validati
 ons. And you'll learn auditing techniques to catch bad data -- before your
  users do.\n\n            \n                  Betsy is a DC-based web deve

DESCRIPTION:Distributed teams can have big benefits for both employers and 
 employees. But there are many challenges. Being successful requires change
 s to work practices\, communication\, and style â and not just from t

  What if you want to build an analytics system on a global scale and want 
 to stay within the Ruby world you know and love?\n\nIn this talk we'll see
  how we can leverage Kafka to build and painlessly scale an analytics pipe
 line. We'll talk about Kafka's unique properties that make this possible\,

DESCRIPTION:There are a lot of database index and query best practices that
  sometimes aren't best practices at all. Need all users created this year?
  No problem! Slap an index over created_at! What about this year's active 
 OR pending users\, sorted by username? Are we still covered index-wise? Is
  the query as fast with 20 million users? Common rules of thumb for indexi
 ng and query crafting arenât black and white. We'll discuss how to tr
 ack down these exceptional cases and walk through some real examples. You'
 ll leave so well equipped to improve performance\, you won't be able to op
 timize fast enough!          \n\n            \n                  Bryana Kn

DESCRIPTION:It'll happen eventually. Someone will come down with a feature 
 request for your app to "create dashboards and reporting on our data". So 
 how do you go about doing it? What parts of your database should you start
  thinking about differently? What is "reporting" anyway? Is ActiveRecord e
 nough to pull this off?\n\nLet's go on a journey through the world of Rela
 tional Online Analytical Processing (ROLAP) and see how this can apply to 
 Rails. We'll also look at database considerations and finish with looking 
 at a light DSL that works with ActiveRecord to help make your data dance.\
