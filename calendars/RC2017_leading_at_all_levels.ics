DESCRIPTION:The ideal workplace\, with motivated employees\, supportive man
 agers and a clear vision in the "C-suite"\, is where we'd all like to work
 \, isn't it? The question then\, is\, how do we create it? How do managers
  walk the fine line of "micromanaging" and "anarchy"? How can we\, as empl
 oyees\, maximize our contribution to our company and love what we do at th
 e same time?\n\nThe secret is in the big band.\n\nInspired by Max Dupree's
  Leadership Jazz\, this talk will show you how to apply the principles of 
 improvisation to your company/team and make your workplace more efficient\
 , effective and fun!\n\n            \n                  Minnesota-raised\,

DESCRIPTION:Leading an open source or community project means dealing with 
 people challenges in addition to technical challenges -- how do we take a 
 scattering of interested people and build a team with them? Turns out\, we
  can adapt a bunch of practices we already use! Using a collaboration betw
 een a nonprofit and a civic group as a case study\, we'll talk about ways 
 to apply best practices from community organizers to our work. In particul
 ar\, we'll talk about similarities between contemporary organizing and agi
 le models\, ways to build relationships with other team members\, and maki
 ng our work more sustainable.\n\n            \n                  Colin is
