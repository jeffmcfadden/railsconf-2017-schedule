DESCRIPTION:Distributed teams can have big benefits for both employers and 
 employees. But there are many challenges. Being successful requires change
 s to work practices\, communication\, and style â and not just from t
 he remote people.  Everyone will experience changes. It helps to be prepar
 ed â¦ and most of what we see being written and discussed is focused o
 n remote workers\, not the organization that supports them.\n\nIn this tal
 k\, we will look at the challenges and rewards of working in a distributed
  team setting based on several years of experience growing large distribut
 ed engineering teams.\n\n            \n                  Maria Gutierrez i

DESCRIPTION:Our company is traditional in many ways\, one of which being th
 e need to come into the office each day. Our team of software developers b
 ucks that trend\, spreading across 6 states and 4 countries. Dev teams con
 sider themselves "Remote First"\, while DevOps and Application Support are
  "Local First." Each has adopted tools\, habits\, and practices to maximiz
 e their configuration. Each style has learned valuable lessons from the ot
 her. This presentation is about how our teams have evolved: the tools\, th
 e compromises\, the wins and losses\, and how we successfully blend Distri
 buted and Concentrated teams.\n\n            \n                  Ben Klang

 breaking and fixing the family computer\, eventually embarking on a career

  technology teams\, and as a result had to start over\, learning all new s
 kills. Today he is proud to work for a company named Fortune #1 Workplace 
 for Camaraderie\, but mostly is happy thanks to the incredible team of hum

DESCRIPTION:Being on a distributed team\, working from your home or coffee 
 shop isn't easy\, but it can be incredibly rewarding.  Making it work requ
 ires constant attention\, as well as support from your team and organizati
 on.  It's more than just setting up Slack and buying a webcam.\n\nWe'll le
 arn what you can do to be your best self as a remote team member\, as well
  as what you need from your environment\, team\, and company.  It's not ab
 out technical stuffâit's the human stuff. We'll learn how can you be 
 present and effective when you aren't physically there.\n\n            \n
