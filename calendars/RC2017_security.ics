DESCRIPTION:Picking an encryption algorithm is like choosing a lock for you
 r door. Some are better than others - but there's more to keeping burglars
  out of your house (or web site) than just the door lock. This talk will r
 eview what the crypto tools are and how they fit together with our framewo
 rks to provide trust and privacy for our applications. We'll look under th
 e hood of websites like Facebook\, at game-changing exploits like Fireshee
 p\, and at how tools from our application layer (Rails\,) our protocol lay
 er (HTTP\,) and our transport layer (TLS) combine build user-visible featu
 res like single sign-on.\n\n            \n                  I am a softwar
 e developer at Atomic Object. For more than decade I've crafted code into 
 software of all sorts. I enjoy peeking under the hood of everything\, be i
 t math\, or software\, or board games\, or cake.\n\nMichael Swieton\n

 team effort\, so whether you are a beginner or senior level Rails develope
