DESCRIPTION:Machine Learning is no longer just an academic study. Tools lik
 e Tensorflow have opened new doorways in the world of application developm
 ent. Learn about the current tools available and how easy it is to integra
 te them into your rails application. We'll start by looking at a real-worl
 d example currently being used in the wild and then delve into creating a 
 sample application that utilizes machine learning. \n\n            \n     
              A passion for cooking\, programming\, and Japanese brought Ma
 tt to work at Cookpad\, an international recipe sharing website. As a memb
 er of the web team he works to bring together all the technologies they us
 e into the international rails application. Recent adventures has brought 
 about an interest in Machine Learning and figuring out how to use it in or
 der to change the ways we create and share recipes.\n\nMatthew Mongeau\n

DESCRIPTION:What's a better way to understand machine learning than a pract
 ical example? And who hasn't watched the 1997 classic with Jack and Rose? 
 In this talk we will first take a look at some real historical data of the
  event. Then we will use amazing Python libraries to live code several of 
 the most well known algorithms. This will help us understand some fundamen
 tal concepts of how machine learning works. When we're done\, you should h
 ave a good mental framework to make sense of it in the modern world.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Before programming\, before formal probability there was Bayes.
  He introduced the notion that multiple uncertain estimates which are rela
 ted could be combined to form a more certain estimate. It turns out that t
 his extremely simple idea has a profound impact on how we write programs a
 nd how we can think about life. The applications range from machine learni
 ng and robotics to determining cancer treatments. In this talk we'll take 
 an in depth look at Bayses rule and how it can be applied to solve problem
 s in programming and beyond.\n\n            \n                  Schneems w

DESCRIPTION:Natural Language Processing is an interesting field of computin
 g. The way humans use language is nuanced and deeply context sensitive. Fo
 r example\, the word work can be both a noun and a verb. This talk will gi
 ve an introduction to the field of NLP using Ruby.  There will be demonstr
 ations of how computers fail and succeed at human language. You'll leave t
 he presentation with an understanding of both the challenges and the possi
 bilities of NLP and some tools for getting started with it. \n\n
