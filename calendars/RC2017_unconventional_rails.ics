DESCRIPTION:Board games are great\, but who has time to keep track of what'
 s going on when you just want to have fun?\nIn the spirit of over-engineer
 ing we'll look at PitchCar -- probably one of the simplest games in the wo
 rld -- and see how far we can go with web tech\, image processing\, and a 
 bunch of math.\nExpect to see plenty of code\, some surprising problems an
 d solutions\, and of course: A live demo.\n\n            \n               
    Dave loves to play games\, he also loves engineering solutions to probl
 ems which may or may not actually exist.\nHe's a graduate of computer scie
 nce and robotics who has been programming professionally for a decade.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Chatbots\, ActionCable\, A.I. and you. And many more buzzwords 
 will enthral you in this talk.\n\nWe'll learn how to create a simple chatr
 oom in Rails using ActionCable\, then how to talk to your colleagues in th
 e office or remote locations using text to speech and Amazon Voice Service
 .\n\nUsing the power of ActionCable we will explore how its possible to cr
 eate an MMMOC: massively multiplayer online chatroom\, that you can use TO
 DAY to see your\; Travis Build status\, or deploy code to your favourite P
 AAS\, let you know when the latest release of Rails is out. Using nothing 
 but your voice and ActionCable.\n\n            \n                  Julian

 things or are willing to pretend you should go and introduce yourself. Oth

 fabulous.\n\nJulian Cheal\n                \n                \n

DESCRIPTION:Ruby on Rails is a widely used web framework\, using HTTP to se
 rve users web pages and store data to databases. But what about serving di
 fferent types of clients? Is it possible to integrate Rails with other pro
 tocol types to talk to other machines? Is it efficient? How would it work?
  I'm going to share my team's approach integrating a Ruby on Rails applica
 tion with automation and warehouse hardware\, such as barcode scanners and
  Zebra printers.\n\n            \n                  Danielle is a full-sta

DESCRIPTION:We live in a world where you can schedule a meeting by talking 
 to your watch or turn off your lights by asking Alexa as if she were your 
 roommate. But would voice dictation work for something more intensive\, li
 ke a web app used for hours of data entry?\n\nIn this talk\, Iâll sho
 w you how to implement the Web Speech API in a few simple steps. Iâll
  also walk through a case study of using the API in a production Rails app
 . Youâll leave with an understanding of how to implement voice dictat
 ion on the web as well as criteria to evaluate if voice is a viable soluti
 on to a given problem.\n\n            \n                  Cameron is a Sof
