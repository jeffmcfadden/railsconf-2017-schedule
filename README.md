# Railsconf 2017 Schedule

iCal files (ics) for the 2017 Railsconf schedule, as well as the tools used to generate them.

# tl;dr Give me the Calendars

Subscribe to these in your favorite calendaring app:

**Everything** [Everything.ics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffmcfadden/railsconf-2017-schedule/master/calendars/main_events.ics)
This includes every event in the events list. This is super dense and most likely going to be really hard to read in your calendaring app. I recommend importing the other files individually so you can turn various tracks on and off as you need.

[Main Events.ics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffmcfadden/railsconf-2017-schedule/master/calendars/main_events.ics)
This includes keynotes, meals, and breaks.
